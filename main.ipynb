You can see this in IC 47 that Rick has attached.  When the scram is reset, the rods then settle to the notched position in a reasonable amount of time.  I would think the rods would settle in this fashion prior to resetting the scram.  The scram can be reset in IC 47 using the scram reset switch on the 901-5 panel.

However, we\\'ve discovered we have an issue in that the control rods drift inward during a hydraulic ATWS as the scram is reset.  If you repeatedly scram and reset the scram the rods move in a notch or two each time.  The problem isn\\'t that they move inward some, but that they move inward as the scram is reset (as the scram valves close) instead of as the scram is inserted (as the scram valves open).\\n=-=\\n@dofarrell 07/14/2016\\nThis issue touched on a few subjects.  After some discussion with CRD system engineers, it was agreed that the performance of the rods when scrammed with with a RD13/RD30 malfunction inserted was correct.  There were other problems that had been identified during various ATWS tests that identified a flaw in the logic that would determine if a CRD was latched or not.  This was corrected with a code change in RDMECH.F made while at site.  A renamed version for comparison purposes has been attached here (RDMECH.F_14July16).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the latching logic had to do with the performance of the CRD collet pins.  When the collet pins have been spread apart, the rod can descend past a notch position.  In order for the collet pins to be spread, CRD water must be applied at sufficient pressure to push the pins up.  This is not the same as having high pressure in the over-piston space which was part of the previous logic.  High pressure CRD water to the under collet pin area is available when the \\'122\\' valve is opened on a withdraw signal.  Modified the code to reflect this.  Tested the condition in scenario LOCT-1061 where there were rods drifting out of the core past notch positions as the RPV was depressurized.\\n=-=\\n@rbaker 07/12/2016\\nThe issue noticed in DR# 6167 has returned. This DR and all associated RD issues are now a major problem.\\n=-=\\n@rbaker 07/07/2016\\nUploaded IC37 zip file to testing at CTI.\\r\\nAlso attached the SmartScenario file used to recreate the issue.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 07/01/2016\\nOur testing is showing the above fix isn\\'t going to work as is or more coding appears to be needed.  With the hydraulic lock malfunction (RD13), we are seeing cases of the control rods drifting outward at times.  Rick will attach as IC where this occurred.\\r\\nThis drifting out consisted of all the control rods at position 00 moving out to position 02.  The latching at the notch position 00 didn\\'t occur as expected.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 02/09/2016\\nRods 60-177 were moving because two paths that need to be blocked were delayed by one cycle. This was the BAD response and should not be used as the reference for the first 59.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe malfunction blocks 3 pathways to bottle up the HCU volume above the piston:\\r\\n1 - scram outlet valve (path to SDV)\\r\\n2 - piston leak-by (path to volume below the piston)\\r\\n3 - cooling water path from above piston area (path to Rx vessel)\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried increasing capacitance terms in the HCU model for the 2 nodes above the piston. Rods move in from 144\" to about 143.2\" then settle back down when pressures equalize. You may see the tick mark on the full core display but never a step in to the next notch.\\r\\nThese capacitance values can NOT be raised too much, or maybe even at all, as the pressure needs to rise quickly on a normal withdraw sequence.\\r\\nThe withdraw pressure must quickly rise up after the initial insert to hold the collet fingers open before the rod passes by the notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought this was as close as the desired response (zero rod motion) for the malfunction at 100% severity. Ramping the severity gives you control on how far the rods move in before full hydraulic lock.\\r\\nAll the patches that were added (and now removed) were to get rid of any blip.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 02/09/2016\\nYves,\\r\\n    When I insert RD13A/B at 100% severity, I see the very small blip in rod movement in SimView, but yes, the full core display remains at 48.  Before the last change, I would see rods 60-177 move in to about position 44 while rods 1-59 did not move.

The following is one of the paragraphs in this section:\\r\\nThe allowable operating limits on withdrawal and insertion speed are determined by requirements for the insert-before-withdraw motion and for jogging. These limits are lower than those which might be set by considering the maximum allowable reactivity variations. The jog withdrawal operation of the drive is an excellent test of the correctness of the speed setting; the drive generally will fail to withdraw if the speed is incorrectly adjusted. A pressure of approximately 60 psi higher than reactor pressure must be maintained above the\\r\\nmain drive piston in order to keep the collet unlocked. Any malfunction which allows the pressure to drop below this value, a condition necessary for higher withdrawal speeds, results in collet locking.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/19/2014\\nIn a manual for Perry, it says the spring force is 150 pounds, but without the surface exposed to the pressures, that doesn\\'t tell me the dP between the two sides.\\r\\nThe model is using 100 PSI right now, but I have no reference for it.\\r\\nCRD drive pressure should be maintained 260 psi above Rx vessel.\\r\\nThis is to maintain a controlled rod speed, as speed is controlled by throttling the exhaust side of the insert or withdraw valve pairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few considerations if the dP is increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf CRD drive pressure is low enough, at some point you will not be able to hold the fingers retracted and you will not be able to withdraw a rod.\\r\\nIf someone knows how low CRD drive pressure can go and still allow you to withdraw a rod, that would mean it\\'s enough pressure to hold the fingers and would give a high limit on the required dP.\\r\\nIf you change the model to require 200 psid to hold the fingers, rod withdrawal would not be possible with CRD drive less than 200 psid above vessel pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond issue is that during a rod withdrawal, the rod is first inserted, then the withdraw valves are open and pressure builds up above the piston to 1) hold the fingers open and 2) push the rod out. There is a small time delay between the opening of the withdraw valve and pressure buildup above the piston. If the rod can drop back down by gravity before the fingers are help open, the rod could get latched again. I have not tried higher finger dP values to see how far it can be pushed without causing problems for a normal rod withdraw operation.\\r\\nWith degraded CRD drive pressure, this problem gets worse as the initial upward rod motion is reduced by the inadequate pressure and the rod may not unlatch properly or relatch before the collet fingers are held out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn routine RDMECH.f, the finger dP is only used in one place.\\r\\nYou can search for the following text and create a database constant to replace the 100.0 and experiment with higher values.\\r\\n(THPCELL(89) + 100.0)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lesson plan says \"Full drive pressure is needed to hold the collet\\r\\nfingers extended.\" and normal drive pressure is shown as 260-350 above vessel pressure.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 10/19/2014\\nYves,\\r\\n    How big of a pressure difference (between withdrawal header and the vessel pressure) does the model need to hold the collet springs open?  I can\\'t find where I read it, but I believe 200 psid is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Question: ********\\r\\nWith the vessel depressurized, would they keep the CRD pump running? The CRD charging path open?\\r\\nFrom IC-89/90, I see the rods held up by charging pressure.\\r\\nIsolate charging to see the rods settle at 0.\\r\\n** Yes, They would keep the CRD pump running. The CRD charging path would only be isolated in the case of an ATWS and they were isolating the -25 valve so as to raise drive pressure so they could insert control rods to 00.  The only time the pump would ever be stopped is if cooling (TBCCW) was lost or in the very rare case of if they had a very high torus pressure, they could get to a place where they are directed to isolate injection from outside containment which CRD would fall into.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/18/2014\\nJust a few more notes about the rods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen latched, a rod is supported by the collet finger and can not move down.\\r\\nAny motion will start on the way up. The rod will move up when the pressure under the piston creates enough force to overcome the rod weight and the forces generated by the pressures above the piston. Two pressures are applied above the piston. The ring around the piston shaft is at the withdrawal header pressure. The end of the piston shaft is subject to the vessel pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a scram, with the scram signal still active, the withdrawal header is tied to the SDV but there is a check valve on that path that will isolate it from the SDV if pressure drops, so SDV pressure is not in play. The withdrawal header also bleeds to the vessel through a restrictive internal path and settles close to the vessel pressure.\\r\\nCRD charging is providing fluid to reload the accumulators and is holding pressure under the rod pistons higher than vessel pressure with the scram inlet valves open, already creating some dp to offset the rod weight, but not enough to push it up.\\r\\nIf vessel pressure drops quickly from that point, that cuts down the total downward force and there is enough net upward force to push the rods in, past the 0 position.\\r\\nThe collet springs are held open by the pressure difference between the withdrawal header and the vessel pressure. The path from the withdrawal header to the vessel is restrictive and there will be a lag between the vessel pressure response and the withdrawal header response. If the pressure difference builds up enough, the fingers are held open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe check valve chatter that I saw may have cut off the pressure below the piston enough to cause the rod to move down while the fingers were held open.\\r\\nThe attached change may keep pressure below the rod piston stable and high enough to just hold the rod in the overtravel position.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the vessel depressurized, would they keep the CRD pump running? The CRD charging path open?\\r\\nFrom IC-89/90, I see the rods held up by charging pressure.\\r\\nIsolate charging to see the rods settle at 0.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the charging flow path is isolated before the depressurization, CRD cooling flow will be restored, which is lower than the charging orifice allows, so there is less CRD supply under the rod and it bleeds through the rod cooling internal path quicker than the charging flow. It may not push the rods in at all during the quick depressurization.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/18/2014\\nIn IC-90, rods are \"floating\" around position 0.\\r\\nSome are inserted beyond 0, some drifted out past actual 0 position.\\r\\nClosing CRD valve 25 at this point lets the rods settle to the next notch - the ones inserted past 0, settled back down to 0.\\r\\nThe other ones settle down to 2.\\r\\nThe IC is past the point where the rods drifted down past the 0 notch, so I can\\'t see the evolution that released the collet fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvide an IC just before vessel depressurization and let me know how to do that final step (or snap it in the IC but do not run through it).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the other issue about the stall test, an IC right where the rod is stuck in the over travel would be helpful to see what the pressures are in the HCU, where the valves are, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIC-90 shows check valves on the HCU charging line bouncing around.\\r\\nChange in HCUPREMANIN.f to get rid of that.\\r\\nAfter this change, charging flow keeps pressure below HCU piston and all rods are pushed in (over-travel) from IC-89/90.\\r\\nClosing -25 lets all rods settle back down to 0.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 10/09/2014\\nAs I discussed in entry 19583 above, I feel the operation of the collet fingers does not work correctly.  Also, the fix we implemented with item 3 in entry 19273 above has introduced a problem with normal insertion of control rods.  If a rod is fully inserted and the insert stall flow test is performed, then when the rod movement control switches are released, the rod is staying at the past full-in (--) position. It should settle back out to position 00.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 09/11/2014\\nI reopened this DR because we had another occurrence of control rods drifting outward during a training scenario.  The condition was snapped into IC-89.  Also, just prior to the control rods moving was snapped into IC-90.  The rod drifting occurred when a reactor blowdown with relief valves was being performed.  Rods had been at position 00 for an extended time, scram valves were open and the scram discharge volume was full.  When IC-89 or IC-90 is taken to run, you can see the rods drift outward.  I don\\'t see any reason for the collet fingers to be held in the outward position and allow the rod to move outward past a notch.  We did notice that if you close the CRD -25 valve using remote function RD04R, the rods initially drift outward a bit more quickly during the valve movement, but then did latch at the next notch.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/25/2014\\nTested SAT.  Performed multiple random testing with RD13 active at 100% and verified control rods did not withdraw by themselves as had previously been occurring.  Verified normal control rod movement has not been afffected.  Performed random partial tests of other RD related malfunctions to verify no new issues introduced from the change made for the resolution of this DR. Determined fast insertion with scram valves open appears to be the correct response given the higher dp developed until accumulators depressurize down to reactor pressure.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nOk, I\\'ll retest it starting from the full power IC.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 08/14/2014\\nI can see from the IC-88 values that it was created before the latest changes were provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see the rods you mention sitting just past the notch (J-9 for example is at 18.0105\", with an indicated position of 6) as they were allowed to budge a little with malfunction RD13 active.\\r\\nAs described in a previous note, the rod barely moved up with the scram but that was enough to unlatch it but not enough to affect the indication. The upper piston pressure built up, squeezed by the increased lower piston pressure and kept the collet fingers released, allowing the rod to float around its initial position, possibly past the notch. This is where the IC-88 is.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the latest change, RD13 absolutely locks up the rod, so it stays latched and the collet fingers are not releasing it which prevents it from drifting out below the notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started from a full power IC where the rods are latched right at the notch and they don\\'t budge at all when a scram is inserted with the RD13 malfunctions at 100%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should look right if you start from a power IC, insert malfunctions RD13 and scram the reactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need to recover that IC-88, I can provide code to get the rods where they should be.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nI uploaded an animated powerpoint which shows a withdraw of a CRD.  It shows the sequence needed for unlatching the collet fingers.  The drive needs to get to a position on the index tube where the collet fingers are pushed out and then have sufficient drive pressure to keep the collet fingers in the pushed up / held out position in order to have the rod move outward past a notch.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nRick uploaded IC88 which helps show a problem that seems to remain with rods not latching completely or moving outward when not expected.  If you take the IC to run, you will see after a few seconds that rod H-9 is being inserted by the operator.  When H9 reaches position 00, select rod J-9 while leaving the rod in switch still driving the rod in.  You will see J-9 jump to position 08 before it starts to insert.  If you let J-9 drive in to position 00, and then de-select it and select J-7, you will see the same thing happen for J-7.  These rods should not jump out to position 08 prior to starting to insert.\\n=-=\\n@rbaker 08/13/2014\\nThe changes were merged on-site and added to the Ready for Test load.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 08/12/2014\\nMultiple issues at play\\r\\n\\r\\n1 - Initial issue with rods drifting out\\r\\nRevisited the \"RD:NOTCH\" logic to identify when the rod passes by an even notch with no pressure on the collet fingers.\\r\\n \\r\\n2 - IC-87 - Fast insertion speed\\r\\nThe scram signal is still present in the IC , so the path to the accumulator is still open through the scram inlet valve.\\r\\nShould you be moving rods with the scram valves open?\\r\\nThe reactor pressure is also lower than normal with a steam line break present, taking away some of the force opposing the insertion pressure.\\r\\nWith these 2 conditions, when the insert command lines up the insert supply and outlet valve, there is more flow than the normal drive flow.\\r\\nAccumulators are nearly depleted in IC-87 (about one minute to go), so that\\'s why speed returns to normal when you get to K6.\\r\\n\\r\\n3 - IC-87 - Rods drifting out\\r\\nFlow paths have to be blocked inside the HCU to prevent ANY indicated rod motion when malfunction RD13 is active vs just blocking the path to the SDV, otherwise there was a path for rod cooling which allowed the rod to push in slowly during a scram.\\r\\nWith RD13 active and scram occurs, pressure applied below the HCU piston squeezes water in upper part of piston and minimal rod motion was enough in the model to indicate it was not latched any more. With other malfunction to reduce reactor pressure, upper piston pressure was even higher to even out forces on piston.\\r\\nWith the rod unlatched AND high upper piston pressure, the collet fingers were released. When accumulator pressures are depleted enough, trapped high pressure pushes down piston, which relieves pressure, allowing the rod to be pushed back up.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolution - Added logic to the flag that blocks rod motion when RD13 or RD30 at 100% so you don\\'t allow upper piston area to get squeezed in and the rod does not get unlatched from a small displacement.\\r\\nThe IC was already past this point, with rods unlatched and high pressure trapped in upper piston area.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in attached RDMECH.f\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/11/2014\\nRick just uploaded another IC which shows control rods being individually inserted with a Scram Discharge Volume Hydraulic Lock (malfunctions RD13A and RD13B) inserted.  The operating crew noticed the individual rods being inserted were inserting very quickly (way faster than normal).  You can see this with rod H9 when the IC is taken to run.  If you select rod H11 right after this, you can see H11 inserting very fast.  When I used rod K6 instead, it inserted near normal speed, but then some other rods drifted in/out a few positions after driving K6 for about 30 seconds.  It seems rods drift out too easily. In the plant, the collet fingers need to be released for a rod to drift out.

If you repeatedly scram and reset the scram the rods move in a notch or two each time.

After some discussion with CRD system engineers, it was agreed that the performance of the rods when scrammed with with a RD13/RD30 malfunction inserted was correct.  There were other problems that had been identified during various ATWS tests that identified a flaw in the logic that would determine if a CRD was latched or not.  This was corrected with a code change in RDMECH.F made while at site.  A renamed version for comparison purposes has been attached here (RDMECH.F_14July16).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the latching logic had to do with the performance of the CRD collet pins.  When the collet pins have been spread apart, the rod can descend past a notch position.  In order for the collet pins to be spread, CRD water must be applied at sufficient pressure to push the pins up.  This is not the same as having high pressure in the over-piston space which was part of the previous logic.  High pressure CRD water to the under collet pin area is available when the \\'122\\' valve is opened on a withdraw signal.  Modified the code to reflect this.

You may see the tick mark on the full core display but never a step in to the next notch.\\r\\nThese capacitance values can NOT be raised too much, or maybe even at all, as the pressure needs to rise quickly on a normal withdraw sequence.\\r\\nThe withdraw pressure must quickly rise up after the initial insert to hold the collet fingers open before the rod passes by the notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought this was as close as the desired response (zero rod motion) for the malfunction at 100% severity.

I was thinking the latest change would cause the 1-59 rods to move in more and be similar to the effect we had with rods 60-177.

The following is one of the paragraphs in this section:\\r\\nThe allowable operating limits on withdrawal and insertion speed are determined by requirements for the insert-before-withdraw motion and for jogging. These limits are lower than those which might be set by considering the maximum allowable reactivity variations. The jog withdrawal operation of the drive is an excellent test of the correctness of the speed setting; the drive generally will fail to withdraw if the speed is incorrectly adjusted. A pressure of approximately 60 psi higher than reactor pressure must be maintained above the\\r\\nmain drive piston in order to keep the collet unlocked. Any malfunction which allows the pressure to drop below this value, a condition necessary for higher withdrawal speeds, results in collet locking.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/19/2014\\nIn a manual for Perry, it says the spring force is 150 pounds, but without the surface exposed to the pressures, that doesn\\'t tell me the dP between the two sides.\\r\\nThe model is using 100 PSI right now, but I have no reference for it.\\r\\nCRD drive pressure should be maintained 260 psi above Rx vessel.\\r\\nThis is to maintain a controlled rod speed, as speed is controlled by throttling the exhaust side of the insert or withdraw valve pairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few considerations if the dP is increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf CRD drive pressure is low enough, at some point you will not be able to hold the fingers retracted and you will not be able to withdraw a rod.\\r\\nIf someone knows how low CRD drive pressure can go and still allow you to withdraw a rod, that would mean it\\'s enough pressure to hold the fingers and would give a high limit on the required dP.\\r\\nIf you change the model to require 200 psid to hold the fingers, rod withdrawal would not be possible with CRD drive less than 200 psid above vessel pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond issue is that during a rod withdrawal, the rod is first inserted, then the withdraw valves are open and pressure builds up above the piston to 1) hold the fingers open and 2) push the rod out. There is a small time delay between the opening of the withdraw valve and pressure buildup above the piston. If the rod can drop back down by gravity before the fingers are help open, the rod could get latched again. I have not tried higher finger dP values to see how far it can be pushed without causing problems for a normal rod withdraw operation.\\r\\nWith degraded CRD drive pressure, this problem gets worse as the initial upward rod motion is reduced by the inadequate pressure and the rod may not unlatch properly or relatch before the collet fingers are held out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn routine RDMECH.f, the finger dP is only used in one place.\\r\\nYou can search for the following text and create a database constant to replace the 100.0 and experiment with higher values.\\r\\n(THPCELL(89) + 100.0)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lesson plan says \"Full drive pressure is needed to hold the collet\\r\\nfingers extended.\" and normal drive pressure is shown as 260-350 above vessel pressure.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 10/19/2014\\nYves,\\r\\n    How big of a pressure difference (between withdrawal header and the vessel pressure) does the model need to hold the collet springs open?  I can\\'t find where I read it, but I believe 200 psid is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Question: ********\\r\\nWith the vessel depressurized, would they keep the CRD pump running? The CRD charging path open?\\r\\nFrom IC-89/90, I see the rods held up by charging pressure.\\r\\nIsolate charging to see the rods settle at 0.\\r\\n** Yes, They would keep the CRD pump running. The CRD charging path would only be isolated in the case of an ATWS and they were isolating the -25 valve so as to raise drive pressure so they could insert control rods to 00.  The only time the pump would ever be stopped is if cooling (TBCCW) was lost or in the very rare case of if they had a very high torus pressure, they could get to a place where they are directed to isolate injection from outside containment which CRD would fall into.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/18/2014\\nJust a few more notes about the rods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen latched, a rod is supported by the collet finger and can not move down.\\r\\nAny motion will start on the way up. The rod will move up when the pressure under the piston creates enough force to overcome the rod weight and the forces generated by the pressures above the piston. Two pressures are applied above the piston. The ring around the piston shaft is at the withdrawal header pressure. The end of the piston shaft is subject to the vessel pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a scram, with the scram signal still active, the withdrawal header is tied to the SDV but there is a check valve on that path that will isolate it from the SDV if pressure drops, so SDV pressure is not in play. The withdrawal header also bleeds to the vessel through a restrictive internal path and settles close to the vessel pressure.\\r\\nCRD charging is providing fluid to reload the accumulators and is holding pressure under the rod pistons higher than vessel pressure with the scram inlet valves open, already creating some dp to offset the rod weight, but not enough to push it up.\\r\\nIf vessel pressure drops quickly from that point, that cuts down the total downward force and there is enough net upward force to push the rods in, past the 0 position.\\r\\nThe collet springs are held open by the pressure difference between the withdrawal header and the vessel pressure. The path from the withdrawal header to the vessel is restrictive and there will be a lag between the vessel pressure response and the withdrawal header response. If the pressure difference builds up enough, the fingers are held open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe check valve chatter that I saw may have cut off the pressure below the piston enough to cause the rod to move down while the fingers were held open.\\r\\nThe attached change may keep pressure below the rod piston stable and high enough to just hold the rod in the overtravel position.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the vessel depressurized, would they keep the CRD pump running? The CRD charging path open?\\r\\nFrom IC-89/90, I see the rods held up by charging pressure.\\r\\nIsolate charging to see the rods settle at 0.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the charging flow path is isolated before the depressurization, CRD cooling flow will be restored, which is lower than the charging orifice allows, so there is less CRD supply under the rod and it bleeds through the rod cooling internal path quicker than the charging flow. It may not push the rods in at all during the quick depressurization.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 10/18/2014\\nIn IC-90, rods are \"floating\" around position 0.\\r\\nSome are inserted beyond 0, some drifted out past actual 0 position.\\r\\nClosing CRD valve 25 at this point lets the rods settle to the next notch - the ones inserted past 0, settled back down to 0.\\r\\nThe other ones settle down to 2.\\r\\nThe IC is past the point where the rods drifted down past the 0 notch, so I can\\'t see the evolution that released the collet fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvide an IC just before vessel depressurization and let me know how to do that final step (or snap it in the IC but do not run through it).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the other issue about the stall test, an IC right where the rod is stuck in the over travel would be helpful to see what the pressures are in the HCU, where the valves are, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIC-90 shows check valves on the HCU charging line bouncing around.\\r\\nChange in HCUPREMANIN.f to get rid of that.\\r\\nAfter this change, charging flow keeps pressure below HCU piston and all rods are pushed in (over-travel) from IC-89/90.\\r\\nClosing -25 lets all rods settle back down to 0.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 10/09/2014\\nAs I discussed in entry 19583 above, I feel the operation of the collet fingers does not work correctly.  Also, the fix we implemented with item 3 in entry 19273 above has introduced a problem with normal insertion of control rods.  If a rod is fully inserted and the insert stall flow test is performed, then when the rod movement control switches are released, the rod is staying at the past full-in (--) position. It should settle back out to position 00.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 09/11/2014\\nI reopened this DR because we had another occurrence of control rods drifting outward during a training scenario.  The condition was snapped into IC-89.  Also, just prior to the control rods moving was snapped into IC-90.  The rod drifting occurred when a reactor blowdown with relief valves was being performed.  Rods had been at position 00 for an extended time, scram valves were open and the scram discharge volume was full.  When IC-89 or IC-90 is taken to run, you can see the rods drift outward.  I don\\'t see any reason for the collet fingers to be held in the outward position and allow the rod to move outward past a notch.  We did notice that if you close the CRD -25 valve using remote function RD04R, the rods initially drift outward a bit more quickly during the valve movement, but then did latch at the next notch.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/25/2014\\nTested SAT.  Performed multiple random testing with RD13 active at 100% and verified control rods did not withdraw by themselves as had previously been occurring.  Verified normal control rod movement has not been afffected.  Performed random partial tests of other RD related malfunctions to verify no new issues introduced from the change made for the resolution of this DR. Determined fast insertion with scram valves open appears to be the correct response given the higher dp developed until accumulators depressurize down to reactor pressure.\\n\\n\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nOk, I\\'ll retest it starting from the full power IC.\\n=-=\\n@ylacombe 08/14/2014\\nI can see from the IC-88 values that it was created before the latest changes were provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see the rods you mention sitting just past the notch (J-9 for example is at 18.0105\", with an indicated position of 6) as they were allowed to budge a little with malfunction RD13 active.\\r\\nAs described in a previous note, the rod barely moved up with the scram but that was enough to unlatch it but not enough to affect the indication. The upper piston pressure built up, squeezed by the increased lower piston pressure and kept the collet fingers released, allowing the rod to float around its initial position, possibly past the notch. This is where the IC-88 is.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the latest change, RD13 absolutely locks up the rod, so it stays latched and the collet fingers are not releasing it which prevents it from drifting out below the notch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started from a full power IC where the rods are latched right at the notch and they don\\'t budge at all when a scram is inserted with the RD13 malfunctions at 100%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should look right if you start from a power IC, insert malfunctions RD13 and scram the reactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need to recover that IC-88, I can provide code to get the rods where they should be.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nI uploaded an animated powerpoint which shows a withdraw of a CRD.  It shows the sequence needed for unlatching the collet fingers.  The drive needs to get to a position on the index tube where the collet fingers are pushed out and then have sufficient drive pressure to keep the collet fingers in the pushed up / held out position in order to have the rod move outward past a notch.\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/14/2014\\nRick uploaded IC88 which helps show a problem that seems to remain with rods not latching completely or moving outward when not expected.  If you take the IC to run, you will see after a few seconds that rod H-9 is being inserted by the operator.  When H9 reaches position 00, select rod J-9 while leaving the rod in switch still driving the rod in.  You will see J-9 jump to position 08 before it starts to insert.  If you let J-9 drive in to position 00, and then de-select it and select J-7, you will see the same thing happen for J-7.

With other malfunction to reduce reactor pressure, upper piston pressure was even higher to even out forces on piston.\\r\\nWith the rod unlatched AND high upper piston pressure, the collet fingers were released. When accumulator pressures are depleted enough, trapped high pressure pushes down piston, which relieves pressure, allowing the rod to be pushed back up.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolution - Added logic to the flag that blocks rod motion when RD13 or RD30 at 100% so you don\\'t allow upper piston area to get squeezed in and the rod does not get unlatched from a small displacement.\\r\\nThe IC was already past this point, with rods unlatched and high pressure trapped in upper piston area.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in attached RDMECH.f\\n=-=\\n@jlechmaier 08/11/2014\\nRick just uploaded another IC which shows control rods being individually inserted with a Scram Discharge Volume Hydraulic Lock (malfunctions RD13A and RD13B) inserted.  The operating crew noticed the individual rods being inserted were inserting very quickly (way faster than normal).  You can see this with rod H9 when the IC is taken to run.  If you select rod H11 right after this, you can see H11 inserting very fast.  When I used rod K6 instead, it inserted near normal speed, but then some other rods drifted in/out a few positions after driving K6 for about 30 seconds.  It seems rods drift out too easily. In the plant, the collet fingers need to be released for a rod to drift out.  The model seems to be lacking this requirement.\\n=-=\\n@rbaker 08/05/2014\\nThe changes for DR# 7944 (rdmech.f) were added to the Training load in question and tested.

      "\n",
      "1. **Add logic to block rod motion when RD13 or RD30 at 100%**: This will prevent the upper piston area from getting squeezed in and the rod from being unlatched due to a small displacement.\n",
      "2. **Block flow paths inside the HCU**: Prevent any indicated rod motion when malfunction RD13 is active, instead of just blocking the path to the SDV. This will prevent rod cooling and allow the rod to push in slowly during a scram.\n",
      "3. **Increase collet finger release pressure**: Make sure that the collet fingers are released only when the rod is truly drifting out, not just when the pressure in the upper piston area is high enough.\n",
      "4. **Implement a \"hold\" logic for rods**: Once a rod is inserted or has completed its motion, hold it in place until the operator intentionally moves it again.\n",
      "5. **Use a more advanced rod motion model**: Consider using a more sophisticated model that takes into account factors such as reactor pressure, temperature, and coolant flow rates to simulate rod behavior during a scram.\n",
