      "1. **Malfunction CV01 - Charging Pump Trip**: Initially, this malfunction wasn't functioning properly due to issues with integration into a new source and incorrect handling in scripts like `SCVD05.for` and `EDSManIn.f`. Actions included adding malfunctions using specific codes for the charging pumps and removing them from flex breakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Breaker Generic Problem**: A reported issue was that breakers would not reclose with an active malfunction trip signal present. The problem was corrected by updating logic in `breaker_comp.f` to allow closure even when a trip signal, including malfunctions, is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **LPCS Malfunction E21-051 Pump Overload**: An incorrect alarm for pump overload was triggered due to ladder logic not considering actual overcurrents properly. This was fixed and retested.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **MCN601A-C Condensate Pump Overcurrent Trip**: The severity of the trip needed adjustment. It was corrected by tweaking the malfunction in `EDSPreManin.f` to cause trips closer to 100% severity, as intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Safeguard Bus D11 Fault**: The immediate tripping caused by a fault on Safeguard Bus D11 due to bus lockout was verified to be from actual fault current and not legacy code issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these examples, it's clear that ensuring malfunctions trigger overcurrent trips properly often involves:\n",
      "- Correctly integrating the malfunction into system scripts.\n",
      "- Adjusting logic to handle specific conditions or signals accurately.\n",
      "- Verifying through testing that changes produce the desired outcomes.\n",

      "   - This entry discusses an issue where the overcurrent trip did not function properly. However, it was resolved by cleaning up equations in SCVD05.for and modifying EDSManIn.f to include malfunction handling.\n",
      "   \n",

      "1. **Review Logic Equations:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the equations or logic handling the overcurrent trip in your system (e.g., similar to SCVD05.for) are correctly written and do not contain any logical errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Malfunction Handling Code:**\n",
      "   - Verify that the malfunction code (e.g., EDSMotMalf for Charging Pumps, as seen in EDSManIn.f) is correctly implemented and handles overcurrent trips as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adjust Trip Severity Parameters:**\n",
      "   - If the issue is similar to MCN601A-C condensate pump overcurrent trip, you may need to adjust parameters (similar to tweaking EDSPreManIN.f) that define when an overcurrent trip should occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Test in a Controlled Environment:**\n",
      "   - Before implementing any changes in production, test the updated logic or parameters in a controlled environment (e.g., simulator or development workstation).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consult Documentation and Previous Fixes:**\n",
      "   - Review related documents such as DR-19-0175 mentioned in the entries for similar issues and their resolutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Engage Subject Matter Experts:**\n",
      "   - If you encounter difficulties, consult with subject matter experts (e.g., @jritter, @dweaver, @vhydro from your data) who have experience with these malfunctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and reviewing the provided entries for similar issues, you should be able to identify and resolve the problem where an overcurrent trip did not occur when it was supposed to.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the data provided, similar issues have been encountered and resolved in the past. For instance, there was a problem with the Charging Pump Trip malfunction (CV01) where the trip wasn't functioning properly due to incorrect handling of the malfunction in the code (`EDSManIn.f`) and its interaction with flex breakers. This was addressed by adding the correct malfunction conditions for motor failures and ensuring that the flex breakers were updated to handle these malfunctions correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another relevant example is the issue with breaker generic problems, where a breaker would not reclose after a trip signal was present due to an active malfunction. The resolution involved updating `breaker_comp.f` to properly handle trip signals even when a malfunction is active, allowing the breaker to close as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your situation, here are some steps you could consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Review Malfunction Implementation**: Ensure that the malfunction you inserted is correctly implemented in your system's logic (e.g., `EDSManIn.f` or equivalent). Verify that all conditions for triggering an overcurrent trip are properly set up and considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Breaker Logic**: If the issue involves a breaker not tripping as expected, review the breaker's logic (`breaker_comp.f` or similar) to ensure it correctly handles malfunctions and trip signals. The logic should allow breakers to trip due to overcurrent conditions even when other malfunctions are active.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consult Previous Resolutions**: Look into previous issues and their resolutions (like those mentioned in the data provided) for guidance on how similar problems were solved. This could involve checking updates made to files like `EDSPreManIN.f`, modifications to flex breaker settings, or adjustments to how overcurrent trips are handled in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Test Thoroughly**: After making any changes, thoroughly test your system under various conditions to ensure the overcurrent trip occurs as expected with the malfunction inserted. This might involve running simulations (like those mentioned for DR-19-0175) and verifying the outcomes against expected behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consult Experts**: If you're still encountering issues after reviewing previous resolutions and making adjustments, consider consulting with experts who have experience with your system's specific logic and malfunctions (`@jritter`, `@dweaver`, etc., as mentioned in the data). They might offer insights or direct solutions based on their past work.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and considering the examples from the provided data, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing the overcurrent trip from occurring when a malfunction is inserted.\n",
