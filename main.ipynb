      "Based on the data you provided, there are several similar issues where malfunctions were introduced for overcurrent trips, but they didn't function as expected initially. Here’s an analysis of what might have gone wrong in your case:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Malfunction Setup**: Ensure that the malfunction is correctly defined and integrated into the system. In previous cases (e.g., \"LPCS malfunction E21-051 pump overload\" or \"MCN601A-C condensate pump overcurrent trip\"), incorrect setup or logic calculations led to issues where trips did not occur as intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logic Errors**: Check if there are any logical errors in the code controlling the overcurrent trip. For example, the \"LPCS pmp overld alarm\" issue was due to improper calculation of a variable (`e22_151x`). Make sure that all variables and conditions for triggering an overcurrent trip are correctly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Integration Issues**: Verify if the malfunction has been properly integrated into the system's current version. As seen in \"MCN601A-C condensate pump overcurrent trip,\" updates were necessary to align severity levels, suggesting integration issues can affect functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **System Configuration**: Ensure that the configuration settings for sensitivity and thresholds are appropriate for detecting the overcurrent condition. In some cases, trips occur at sub-optimal severities due to misconfigured thresholds (e.g., \"MCN601A-C causes overcurrent trip of breaker at about 70% severity\").\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Legacy Code or Interlocks**: Investigate whether any legacy code or interlock mechanisms might be interfering with the malfunction's intended behavior, similar to what was checked in the \"Safeguard Bus D11 Fault\" case.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Testing and Verification**: Conduct thorough testing under various conditions to verify that the malfunction triggers as expected. Review past fixes (e.g., adjustments made by @jritter) for insights on resolving similar issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have already addressed these points and the problem persists, consider consulting with colleagues who might have more context or specific expertise related to your system's configuration and malfunctions.\n",
